# Frequent-Itemset-Apriori-FPTree-CSCM35-Data-Mining
A number of data mining algorithms implemented using grocery store shopping lists as a working example.

The implemented algorithms are:
* Frequent Itemsets
* Apriori
* FPTree Growth (__Step 2 unfinished__)

The notebook file also contains a further performance analysis of the algorithms.
